== Building the Redoc output from OpenAPI specs

[IMPORTANT]
====
Before starting, talk to the documentation team to obtain the following files needed to publish the output:

`processFile.ps1`::
Batch script that handles the `redoc-cli` output generation

`theme.json`::
A custom theme to ensure that the output is branded according to company specifications.
====

. Open the API to be published using SwaggerHub.

. Select *Export* on the right side of the screen.

+
A menu will appear.

. From the menu, select *Download API* > *JSON Resolved*.
+
This downloads the OpenAPI specs as a JSON file.

. Place the OpenAPI specs file into a directory containing both `processFile.ps1` and `theme.json`.

. Open Windows PowerShell and navigate (using `cd`) to the directory where you have placed the OpenAPI specs.


. Type in the following command:
+
[source, powershell]
 .\processFile.ps1 -Filename .\{name of JSON file} -Theme .\theme.json -Output {name of output}.html
+
where 
`{name of JSON file}`:: 
the name of the JSON file that you have downloaded.
`{name of output}`:: 
the name of the output file.
Note that there cannot already be an file with the same name in the directory; either delete this file or use a different name.

+
IMPORTANT: Do not forget to add `.\` before the name of each file (except the output).

The Redoc file will appear with the name `{name of output}.html`.
